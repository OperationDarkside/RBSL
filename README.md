Really Bad Scripting Language

This is an educational project where I tried to find out how few effort is needed to create a basic scripting language. These few hundred lines of code are working like a charm on my system. This code doesn't take endianess into account.

## Functions

There are only two functions at the moment:
- $concat
- $print

## Syntax

- Variables start with a #
- Functions start with a $
- Classes would start with a @ (if I'd have implemented them)
